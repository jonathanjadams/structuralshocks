# structuralshocks
Harmonized dataset of structural macroeconomic shocks for use as instrumental variables

For attribution, please cite the following papers, in which I use this dataset:
 - Adams and Barrett (2025), "What Are Empirical Monetary Policy Shocks? Estimating the Term Structure of Policy News" (IMF Working Paper)
 - Adams and Matthes (2026), "How Ricardian Are We?" (KC FRB Working Paper)

Please use the shocks!  And please email me if you have questions (genuinely!)
