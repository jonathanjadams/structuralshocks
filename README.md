Harmonized dataset of structural macroeconomic shocks for use as instrumental variables

Please use these!  And if you do, please check back (or email me) for appropriate attribution, as the associated working paper has not been released.  

In the meantime, please cite this paper, which uses only the monthly shocks: Adams and Barrett (2025), "What Are Empirical Monetary Policy Shocks? Estimating the Term Structure of Policy News" (IMF Working Paper)
